Certainly! Here’s your `Dockerfile` with detailed comments explaining each instruction:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image from Docker Hub as the base image
# This provides a pre-configured environment with Node.js installed.
FROM node:23

# Set the working directory inside the container
# All subsequent instructions (COPY, RUN, etc.) will use this directory as the current directory.
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Check the version of Node.js installed in the image
# This helps to verify the Node.js version during the build process.
RUN node --version

# Check the version of npm installed in the image
# This verifies the npm version as well.
RUN npm --version

# Copy only the package.json and package-lock.json files to the working directory
# This helps to leverage Docker's caching mechanism, so dependencies are only installed if these files change.
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the dependencies listed in package.json
# This will run `npm install` and create a `node_modules` directory with all necessary packages.
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application source code from the host to the container
# This includes all application files from the `src` directory, but not `node_modules` since it was installed in the previous step.
COPY ./src .

# Specify the command to run the application
# In this case, we're telling Docker to execute `node index.js` when the container starts.
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

### Explanation of Each Step

1. **`FROM node:23`**: This pulls the official Node.js version 23 image from Docker Hub, which includes both Node.js and npm.

2. **`WORKDIR /usr/src/app`**: Sets the working directory for all subsequent instructions. This means all file operations and commands will be executed in `/usr/src/app`.

3. **`RUN node --version` and `RUN npm --version`**: These commands output the Node.js and npm versions during the build, allowing you to verify that you’re using the expected versions in the Docker image.

4. **`COPY package*.json ./`**: Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` from the host machine to the working directory in the container. By copying only these files before running `npm install`, Docker can cache this layer, allowing faster builds if dependencies haven’t changed.

5. **`RUN npm install`**: Installs the application’s dependencies, based on the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files copied in the previous step.

6. **`COPY ./src .`**: Copies the application code from the `src` directory on the host to the working directory in the container. This step ensures all source files are included in the container, except files ignored by `.dockerignore`.

7. **`CMD ["node", "index.js"]`**: Specifies the default command to run when the container starts. Here, it runs the application using `node index.js`. This can be adjusted based on your application's entry point.

This structure and setup is efficient and follows best practices for building Docker images, including caching dependencies and keeping the image size as small as possible by only copying necessary files.
